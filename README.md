BTPasswordGeneratorApps

The solution contains 2 apps. An Web API server built using .NET Core 3.1 (that will run at http://localhost:5000/ and an Angular app using "typescript": "~2.5.3" and Angular 5.2
(will run at http://localhost:4200/)

After installing the Angular dependencies and the Api is build, you can use "Start the apps.bat" to start both of them.
